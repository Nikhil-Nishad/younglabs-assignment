4.  Start the server: `npm start`
5.  Deployed Backend URL: [https://younglabs-backend-0s9n.onrender.com](https://younglabs-backend-0s9n.onrender.com)

**Frontend**

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` folder: `cd frontend`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file and configure the API URL: `VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL=https://younglabs-backend-0s9n.onrender.com` (Note: Update this with the Render URL once deployed)

### Key Features

* **Simple API:** The backend provides a basic greeting endpoint to demonstrate API functionality.

## Additional Notes

* Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
* For local development, you may need to adjust the `REACT_APP_API_URL` in the frontend's `.env` file to `http://localhost:5000` during local development. Remember to switch back to the Render URL for deployment.
* This project demonstrates my ability to quickly set up and deploy a full-stack application, focusing on clean code and efficient development practices.
